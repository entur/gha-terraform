#### **Did you find a bug?**

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch. We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) so please prefix your PR accordingly

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

* Prepend your PR with `docs:` for documentation, `chore:` for maintenance tasks and `style:` for renaming and simple refactoring

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Open an issue and initiate a discussion before starting the work

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**
